# All-about-him
𝐉𝐄𝐒𝐔𝐒, also known as 𝐉𝐄𝐒𝐔𝐒 𝐂𝐇𝐑𝐈𝐒𝐓, is a man who lived over 2,000 years ago in the Middle East. Historically, he was a Jewish teacher and preacher who became known for his powerful teachings about love, forgiveness, and kindness. He was eventually crucified by the Romans. Most historians agree that Jesus truly existed and had a major impact on the world. In the Christian faith, Jesus is believed to be the Son of God and the promised Savior. Christians believe he was born to the Virgin Mary, performed miracles, and taught people about God’s love. They believe he died on the cross to save humanity from sin, and that he rose from the dead after three days — an event called the Resurrection. Christians believe he later went back to heaven and will return one day. His life and teachings are written in the New Testament of the Bible, and he is the central figure of Christianity, followed by billions of people around the world.
