Who is Jesus?

Jesus, also called Jesus Christ, is the central figure of Christianity and is also highly respected in Islam. Christians believe He is the Son of God, the Messiah (Savior), and part of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit).

Jesus Christ is God.

In Christianity, Jesus is not just a man or prophet-He is God Himself who became human to save us.

God the savor

The idea of God the Savior means that God helps us escape sin, suffering, and spiritual death. In Christianity, this belief is embodied by Jesus Christ, who sacrificed himself on the cross for the sake of humanity. His death is regarded as the highest expression of love and compassion. People of faith rely on God to lead, safeguard, and support them during difficult times. Other faiths also teach that God or divine entities offer salvation from wickedness. This belief brings hope, strength, and solace to many across the globe.

  Jesus, also known as Jesus Christ, is a man who lived over 2,000 years ago in the Middle East. Historically, he was a Jewish teacher and preacher who became known for his powerful teachings about love, forgiveness, and kindness. He was eventually crucified by the Romans. Most historians agree that Jesus truly existed and had a major impact on the world. In the Christian faith, Jesus is believed to be the Son of God and the promised Savior. Christians believe he was born to the Virgin Mary, performed miracles, and taught people about God’s love. They believe he died on the cross to save humanity from sin, and that he rose from the dead after three days — an event called the Resurrection. Christians believe he later went back to heaven and will return one day. His life and teachings are written in the New Testament of the Bible, and he is the central figure of Christianity, followed by billions of people around the world.
